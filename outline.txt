Begin with: Who cares?

- You'll be doing it *a lot*
- Wider audience for your work: get people to read your papers (or at least remember you)
- Indication of your teaching ability (but teaching is harder)
- My own strengths: writing and speaking (more than the actual work)




General principles

- Take it seriously (you're being evaluated constantly; think "first impressions")
- Know your audience (generally diverse)
- Have a few key points
- Simplify, simplify, simplify
- Be graphical (graphs over words)
- Lots of possible good styles (lots of ways to be good, lots of ways to be bad)
- Adopt another's style at great peril
- Know yourself
- Pay attention to others' talks
- Tell a story
- Don't bullshit
- Don't go over time
- Give a good summary
- Start with the application (scientific problem)
- Consistent style in slides
- Admit ignorance (particularly in the Q&A part)
- It *is* a performance
- Never overestimate your audience (people like a review; they like to hear things they understand)


Things I don't like

- Outlines (either too simple or requires too much advance explanation)
  (Tell a story; its logical unfolding will make it all clear)
- Unlabelled graphs; unreadable labels
- Graphs/tables straight from a paper
- Covering everything you've ever done
- Too many words
- Reading the slides verbatim
- Computer output
- Too many digits
- Unnecessary notation
- Hard to remember notation
- Lack of eye contact
- Mumbling 
- Lack of motivation
- Serif font (e.g. times)
- Noisy or unnecessary backgrounds
- Powerpoint 
- Unnecessary animation
- Simulation results are almost always dreadfully boring
- Figures, figures, figures (but the right ones)
- Acknowledgements *last* (in case you need to skip it), and be brief
  (noone really cares)
- Extensive references (you can put them on the slides, but don't mention them much if at all)

Other topics

- Practice
   - Practice by giving talks; take over opportunity
   - Think it through carefully
   - Imagine what they're thinking
   - Can you articulate what you're going to say?  Where will you get stuck?
   - Do you know how long it will take?    
   - "10 practice runs for one presentation"
   - I usually have a good idea for my "opening"

- The 10-15 min talk
   - Explain the problem, sketch the solution, give a few results
   - 5-10 slides

- It's easier when you *care* about what you're saying

- Purpose of a scientific presentation: usually, to get them to read
  the paper, or at least convey the interest of the problem

- How to dress: respect for audience
 
- Relax; slow down; occasional silence is okay;
  Lots of people get nervous

- It's okay to screw up now and then (I think)

- Move around

- Exude enthusiasm and confidence

- Logical unfolding of information

- Consistency in colors and labels

- Look at the screen (with the audience) not your computer
  But talk to the audience not the screen

- PDF vs powerpoint:
    - PDF always looks as expected
    - Powerpoint can have terrible graph/font problems
    - Powerpoint makes sharing slides easier
    - Powerpoint can be easier to create

- Care regarding type of graphic file (jpeg/png vs pdf/ps)

- Start with an outline

- Think carefully about colors; color on screen may be different from
  on computer

- Have something to drink on hand

- Slides to remind you of what to say; index cards; I make an index
  card to help find particular slides later

- Opening, transitions

- Noone (as far as I can tell) wants to hear the technical details

- laser pointers: use sparingly; hold with two hands

- Me: I empty my pockets, just in case 

- either explain fully or not at all
- explaining genet to stat & vice versa
- junk at the top and the bottom (do we need a reminder of the title/institution/date?) maybe people do it thinking copyright 
- don't run over: people get itchy & annoyed
- revealing a bit at a time

- Emphasis on writing, but in many cases talks are what get people to read your work

- You should be able to give a talk on your current work at a moment's notice

- Videotaping your rehearsals (I can't stand to look at myself, much
  less listen!)

- Don't apologize

- Avoid getting yourself stuck; feel free to stop and summarize

- Simulations are really boring

- Application *first*, to illustrate the problem, rather than being
  abstract 

Examples:

Thomas Ten Have (and most doing causal inference)

Don Rubin (one slide, no preparation, but I still loved it)

Talks for statisticians, for geneticists and for statistical
geneticists
